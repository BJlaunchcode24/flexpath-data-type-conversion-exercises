### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Data Types**:
    
    - Primitive data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined.
    - Objects and arrays as non-primitive data types.
    - Differences between primitive and reference types.
2. **Type Conversion**:
    
    - Converting between different data types (e.g., strings to numbers, numbers to booleans).
    - Using `typeof` to determine the type of a variable.
    - Handling `NaN` and checking for it using `isNaN`.
3. **String Manipulation**:
    
    - Using template literals for string interpolation.
    - Common string methods like `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `indexOf`, and `includes`.
4. **Date and Time**:
    
    - Working with the `Date` object and its methods, like `toDateString` and `toLocaleDateString`.
    - Formatting dates and times for different locales using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
5. **Number Formatting**:
    
    - Using methods like `Math.round`, `Math.ceil`, and `Math.floor`.
    - Formatting numbers with `toFixed` and for different locales with `Intl.NumberFormat`.
6. **JSON**:
    
    - Converting objects to JSON strings using `JSON.stringify`.
    - Parsing JSON strings back to objects using `JSON.parse`.
    - Handling JSON parsing errors.
7. **Boolean Logic**:
    
    - Truthy and falsy values.
    - Converting values to booleans and understanding boolean contexts.
8. **Locale and Internationalization (i18n)**:
    
    - Using locale codes to format numbers, dates, and currency.
    - The concept of locales and how it affects string and number formatting.
